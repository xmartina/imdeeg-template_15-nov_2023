He said through the Project, many youths have gone through digital training programmes where they have been equipped with digital skills and tools.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHowever, as the SkillUpImo Project progresses, towards achieving our target of training 300,000 Imolites in cutting-edge digital skills, connecting 60 per cent of the graduands to high-paying jobs as well as empowering 40 per cent of the graduands to be their own bosses, a new initiative tagged: \u2018Tech Talent to Jobs (TT2J)\u201d initiative is being birthed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe TT2J will naturally mainstream the graduates of the SkillUpImo Project, where they will now be matched with top level employment opportunities both locally and internationally in countries such as Canada, United States, United Kingdom, other European countries, among others. I am happy to inform you that HIS Excellency, Distinguished Senator has directed the Ministry to workout the modalities for immediate implementation of the new programme, Amadi said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, having seen the great potential in the two initiatives of the Digital Governor \u2013 the SkillUpImo Project and the TT2J &#8211; , a non-governmental organisation, Youth Off The Streets Initiatives (YOTSI), has identified with Imo State on its youth development vision and expressed its readiness to partner with the State.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>President of YOTSI, Comrade Kennedy Nyere, who was on a fact-finding tour to the State recently, said his NGO had extensively understudied the Imo State initiatives in the area of youth empowerment and got convinced that a partnership between the Imo State and its NGO has become necessary for accelerating development in the state.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur vision to, among others, support and empower young people to build a positive future aligns with the great work which the Imo State is doing in the area of youth empowerment initiatives and we are seeking to collaborate with the State\u2019s Ministry of Digital Economy and E-Government through signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in this regard,\u201d Nyere said.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The NGO used the opportunity of its visit to the state to actively interact with the participants of the ongoing Cohort 2 of the State\u2019s SkillUpImo Project during which Nyere extended financial support to some trainees and their family members with a view of motivating them and igniting their entrepreneurial drive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si<em>gned:<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Sandra Opara<br>Public Relations Officer<br>Ministry of Digital Economy &amp; E-Government,<br>Imo State<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>MINISTRY OF DIGITAL ECONOMY AND E GOVERNMENT PRESS RELEASE The Imo State Government has said it is ready to decisively connect trainees from its youth-centric digital empowerment project, the SkillUpImo Initiative, to job opportunities in Nigeria and globally, in countries such as Canada, the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and other European countries, among others. &hellip;<\/p>\n<p class=\"read-more\"> <a class=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/mdeeg.im.gov.ng\/imo-state-to-connect-youths-to-global-tech-job-opportunities\/\"> <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Imo State to Connect Youths to Global Tech Job Opportunities<\/span> Read More &raquo;<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3665,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_eb_attr":"","site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-banner-title-visibility":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"","footer-sml-layout":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[44,32,34],"tags":[50],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/mdeeg.im.gov.ng\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/07\/IMG-20230731-WA0129.jpg?fit=1280%2C704&ssl=1","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mdeeg.im.gov.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3653"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mdeeg.im.gov.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mdeeg.im.gov.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mdeeg.im.gov.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mdeeg.im.gov.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3653"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mdeeg.im.gov.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3653\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mdeeg.im.gov.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3665"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mdeeg.im.gov.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3653"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mdeeg.im.gov.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3653"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mdeeg.im.gov.ng\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3653"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
